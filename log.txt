Thoughts and events of WIP website development:
9/4/13
	-Begin log
	-Bug found (register.php): If email in use, warning says "The email [username] is already in use"
9/5/13	
	-Bug Found: member pages are found at members/[username]/* but usernames aren't necessarily distinct. Need to either verify that all users have different usernames or change directory name from /[username]/
